Hey,

To use this command manager simply copy the classes and class structure over to your project, configure the CommandManager class to your needs.
To add new commands its as simple as adding a new class in subCommands, set the class to extend commandStruct and fill in the structure. Then add the command to the list of commands in CommandManager.
